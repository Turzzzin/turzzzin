## 🧠 About Me

### 🔹 Personal Side  
I’m a curious technologist who also loves animals, music, food, and coffee. In my downtime, you’ll find me gaming (especially VALORANT), exploring new tools, or reminiscing about my time as a small-time Twitch streamer. I love building things that make life easier and learning along the way.

### 🔹 Professional Journey  
My career began with a scholarship at **Compass UOL**, where I explored **AWS**, **Machine Learning**, and **Cognitive Computing**. I built applications for API consumption, trained models with **SageMaker**, and developed a chatbot for educational use.

Later, I joined **Johnson & Johnson** as a Data & Analytics intern, working on their **data platform team**. There, I gained hands-on experience with:

- ✅ Data pipelines using **AWS Glue**, **Step Functions**, and **Spark**
- ✅ CI/CD using **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, and **Bitbucket**
- ✅ Building integrations with systems like **Salesforce**
- ✅ Reducing costs by implementing **Spark on Lambda** ([LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247672876407918593/))
- ✅ Supporting **Spark on Kubernetes** with **Karpenter**

These roles deepened my expertise across the **data engineering stack**, from architecture to automation, and reinforced my passion for building scalable data solutions.
